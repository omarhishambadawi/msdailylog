/**
 * Centralized React Query key factory.
 *
 * Why this exists: React Query prefix-matches invalidation keys **element by
 * element**, so `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["orders"] })` matches
 * `["orders", "page", …]` but NOT `["orders-page", …]` — `"orders-page"` and
 * `"orders"` are different strings, not a prefix relationship. The codebase had
 * flat, hyphenated keys (`orders-page`, `dashboard-kpis`, `complaint`) and
 * several invalidations written against the entity name (`["orders"]`,
 * `["dashboard"]`). Those calls compiled, ran, matched nothing, and silently
 * left stale data on screen.
 *
 * The rule this file enforces: **the first element is the entity, and every
 * query for that entity nests under it.** That makes `entity.all()` a real
 * invalidation boundary.
 *
 *   queryKeys.orders.all()          →  ["orders"]                    ← sweeps everything below
 *   queryKeys.orders.page(f)        →  ["orders","page",f]
 *   queryKeys.orders.kpi(f)         →  ["orders","kpi",f]
 *   queryKeys.orders.detail(id)     →  ["orders","detail",id]
 *
 * Lookup data (agent/branch dropdowns) deliberately lives under its own
 * `lookups` root rather than under `orders`/`dashboard`. It is reference data
 * that does not change when an order does, so nesting it beneath an entity
 * would make every order write needlessly re-fetch the directory.
