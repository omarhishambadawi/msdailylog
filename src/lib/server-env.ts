/**
 * Reconciles the two names every Supabase value travels under.
 *
 * Lovable Cloud's Supabase connection injects the `VITE_`-prefixed names, because
 * that is what its generated client reads via `import.meta.env`. This repo's own
 * server code — the auth middleware, the MCP tools, the public CDR route — reads
 * the unprefixed names off `process.env` instead (see .env.example). Locally that
 * works because `.env` defines both sets by hand; in an environment where only one
 * set is present, every server-side reader throws "Missing Supabase environment
 * variable(s)" even though the value is right there under the other name.
 *
 * So: fill each gap from whichever side has the value. `src/lib/security-headers.ts`
 * already reads both names for exactly this reason; this generalizes it rather than
 * repeating the fallback at each call site — which matters because the files that
 * need it most (`client.ts`, `client.server.ts`, `auth-middleware.ts`) are generated
 * and would lose any edit on the next regeneration.
 *
 * Only browser-safe values are bridged. SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY bypasses RLS and
 * is deliberately absent from the list: a `VITE_`-prefixed service role key would be
 * inlined into the public bundle, so if one ever appears it must NOT be honoured.
