/**
 * Yeastar CDR aggregation — queue-aware, Internal excluded.
 *
 * A queue call can hit multiple agents in sequence. Each attempt is its
 * own CDR row. We group rows by (call_id || linkedid || linked_id) and
 * treat the group as ONE call. If the PBX omits a correlation id we
 * fall back to a *sliding* fingerprint: a leg joins the previous group
 * with the same from/to whose last leg was within QUEUE_LEG_WINDOW_SEC
 * (so boundary-straddling legs don't split and unrelated calls in the
 * same window don't merge). — H1 fix.
 *
 * Direction is taken from the first leg; all legs in a queue call share
 * the same direction, so this is not a majority calculation.
 *
 *   Global (platform) counters (Internal excluded):
 *     - Answered = ANY row in the group has disposition = ANSWERED
 *     - Missed   = Inbound group, no row answered, max WAIT >= 5s
 *                  (queue auto-forward flows end with an ANSWERED row and
 *                  are therefore NOT counted as Missed at platform level)
 *     - Abandoned= Inbound group, no row answered, max WAIT <  5s
 *                  (wait, not ring — H5 fix)
 *     - Outbound "No Answer" = Outbound group with no ANSWERED row
 *                  (kept for per-agent stats — NEVER rolled into Missed)
 *
 *   Per-agent counters use RAW rows so per-agent missed reflects the
 *   agent's own unanswered ring even when the queue later forwarded
 *   the call to someone else. Per-agent `missed` is inbound-only (M1).
 *
 *   Talk seconds sum across ALL answered legs in a group (M2), not just
 *   the first, so transferred calls report full talk time.
 *
 *   Waiting Time separates queue WAIT from agent RING (H5):
 *     - `waitSeconds` / `avgWaitSec` — inbound, answered + abandoned
 *     - `ringSeconds` / `avgRingAnsweredSec` — answered only

  // ---- Reconciliation intentionally REMOVED ------------------------------

  // That destroyed the correct classified totals whenever an agent could
  // not be resolved (queue-inbound rows with dst=<queue number> → no
  // roster match → unmatched → agent totals = 0 → platform Inbound
  // zeroed out even though CDR clearly showed inbound calls).
  //
  // Rule: platform KPIs come from classified CDR groups above and stay
  // authoritative. Per-agent stats are supplemental and never mutate them.
